* Fix issue #208 Squawker not saving account credentials when it is closed
  and also issue #216 After updating to latest version, twitter / X account didn't save from the previous version. It was wiped out.
* Fix issue #200 Download media feature not working.
* Implement feature #111 Allow audio & video to continue playing when app is minimised.
  Also implement feature #210 Muted videos: start video only, keep music playing.
  There are now two options implemented, enabled by default (under Settings / General / Media) :
  - Allows video to continue to play when Squawker is in the background
  - Allows video/music of other apps to play in the background while a video is playing in Squawker.
* Implement feature #219 Allow to set a proxy HTTP(S) or SOCKS5.
  The proxy can be set under Settings / General then tap on the Proxy item.
  The format is: scheme://[user:pwd@]host:port.
  Eg https://1.2.3.4:5678 or socks5://who:ami@9.8.7.6:2468.
