* Fix the issue with a video after opening the download option, when clicking on download nothing happens.
* Implement feature #210 Muted videos: start video only, keep music playing.
  There are now two options implemented, enabled by default (under Settings / General / Media) :
  - Allows video to continue to play when Squawker is in the background
  - Allows video/music of other apps to play in the background while a video is playing in Squawker.
