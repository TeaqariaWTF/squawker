## Features:

* Sync: In sync with the current fritter build
* Updates: Constantly updated and improved
* Private: Doesn't use the official twitter api

## Contribute
If you'd like to help make Quacker even better, here are a just a few of the ways you can help!

### Report a bug
If you've found a bug in Quacker, open a [new issue](https://github.com/thehcj/quacker/issues/new/choose), but please make sure to check that someone else hasn't reported it first.

### Request a feature
If you feel like something is missing from Quacker, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/thehcj/quacker/issues/new/choose) about it, detailing exactly what you're looking for. We'll look it over, discuss it with the community, and see if it'll work!

### Fix a bug
If you're looking for something to dip your toes into the codebase, check if there are any issues labelled good first issue. Otherwise, if you see another issue you'd like to tackle, go for it - just fork the repository, push to a branch, and create a PR detailing your changes. We'll review it and merge it in, once it meets all our checks and balances!

### Translations
Quacker currently uses Fritter's [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/fritter/) for translations. You can help by translating the app into your preferred language(s)! I will be moving away from this in version 5.0.0, I will announce a replacement when the time has come.

#### Next steps:
* Mastodon support - for being able to browse both Twitter and Mastodon content
* Persistent timeline positions - allowing you to continue where you left off in a feed
* Desktop support - allowing you to browse Twitter privately on a full-blown computer
* UX/UI improvements - such as a compact view, and tweaks to improve usability
* Nitter support - adding Nitter support back in, and helping to develop a stable API for Nitter itself
* Notifications - getting notified when selected subscriptions or groups have new tweets
* Stability - continued updates to improving the stability and reliability of the app
